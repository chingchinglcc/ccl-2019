description: The design and development of educational apps for mobile devices with children in a K-12 classroom. This app is unique because it integrates curricular task recall with an engaging adventure and story. It also gives a unique form of presenting the Coalbanks School to new students, parents, or teachers.

#video_subtitle: This is our pleasure to be interviewed by the CTV Lethbridge.
video_descp: What set the direction for us, perhaps unconsciously, was the fact that our school has the bigger list of content on our class’ Weebly site.  It turned out that the kids we were working with were from different classes, not just the teacher were were “paired” to. We thought that if we catered to all topics, we could include their teachers as character, thus making it would be more marketable as a school-wide experience.  We knew we were on the right track when a student suggested later, when we first met the group. Our students came from a number of classrooms and had all been working on different topics. After our first meeting with the students, we decided that we wanted to be able to hit topics across the program of study considering the fact that they had not all had the same material presented to them.

<!-- The design and development of educational apps for mobile devices with children in a K-12 classroom. 

It was the process that provided a significant learning opportunity for me. From a New Media and Computer Science perspective, I acquired useful experience from working on a real-world problem that requires designing and coding an effective app for children. Also, I was encouraged to be reflective thinkers as I worked in a team, brainstormed ideas, completed needs analysis, developed instructional designs, researched, developed and then created the app. I have a better understanding of how such endeavours can be organised and conducted through this project.

The most important aspect of the experience is field testing the prototype apps with stakeholders like children, teachers, and parents.  I was able to get useful insights and understanding for improvements to the product and insights into the thinking of the target audience.  It raised my awareness in terms of the design and interactivity required.   -->
