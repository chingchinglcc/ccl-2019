    <p class="bio">
        I completed my Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media at the University of Lethbridge. My focus is on web development. And my favourite langauge is CSS.
        Over the last 4 years University life, I built up a strong passion for coding, and am proud to say "I love coding".
        I interned in a digital marketing agency in Calgary. During my work experience, I've been building websites for local communities and national companies. 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the strongest coding langauges I have so far. I love using these 3 languages because these langauges enchances the UI and UX of a website.
        Nowadays, I am very interested in the back-end development process and langauge since I've experienced PHP.
